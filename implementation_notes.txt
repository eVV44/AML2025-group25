With this project, there are two main constraints:
1. Extremely low number of images (3926) for the number of classes (200). This presents a high risk of overfitting.
2. A limit on computational power.

Compared to the baseline model, the additional attribute data provides an advantage to include specific bird (domain) knowledge.

EXAMPLE:
With these constraints in mind we opt for:
1. Average pooling (also, blurring):
    - Attempt to reduce overfitting by averaging features.
    - Lower computational complexity by reducing the number of parameters.
2. Dropout (specifically, cutout or coarse dropout to disable patches/parts of the image):
    - Reduce overfitting by removing reliance on specific features (turned off sometimes)
3. Data augmentation:
    - ...
...

Possible approaches:
1. Multi-input model (concatenate image data and attribute data)
2. Multi-task model (predict class and attribute separately, combine result into final prediction)
3. Embedding model (Image embeddings of class_x are close to the attribute vector of class_x)
